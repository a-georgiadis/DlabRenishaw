# Dionne Group Renishaw Raman Spectrometer Software

This repository is used for working on and collaborating on shared software infrastructure for using, automating and analyzing data from the Dlab renishaw instrument. In this package you will find a

- Library of functions for interfacing with the instrument
- PyQT5 based interface as a supplementary method for operating the Renishaw instrument
- Example scripts for interfacing with the Renishaw instrument
- General documentation for use of the instrument
- Data analysis scripts for performing


Ongoing Projects:
1. Automated Liquid Well Mapping
2. Surface fitting of best focus
    - Track plane of best visual focus and Raman focus for various samples of interest
3. Instructions for calibrating new objectives


Projects in Queue:
